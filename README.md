# CDN Repository

This repository serves as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for my academic activities. It contains minified files and compressed assets for faster and efficient dependency usage.

## Usage

To use the files in this CDN repository, you can include them directly in your HTML or CSS code using the following URLs:

- For JavaScript files:
  
  <script src="https://cdn.example.com/js/myfile.js"></script>

- For CSS files:
  
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.example.com/css/mystyle.css">

Please note that the above URLs are just placeholders. Replace them with the actual URLs of your hosted files.
